This is a basic tool that allows you to write any text you want and encrypt it/saving in a txt file. (Like storing it for futher use).
Also the tool provides a decrypt function when you want to decrypt those txt files. 

I made this tool mainly beacuse sometimes I wanted to write some toughts for some of my histories, and many times I feel silly about those. So a good option is write them, store instantly and then "reveal it" many time later. A some sort of mini-tool for making histories :D 

It's made in AutoIt3, but I already made an executable if you are lazy. 
Also you can tune the encryption key in config.ini.
